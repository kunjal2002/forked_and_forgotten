**Forked and Forgotten: The Uncertain Lifespan of Open-Source Developers**

This project explores the dynamics of open-source software development, focusing on the lifespan and retention of contributors in open-source projects. The study aims to provide insights into how different factors influence the sustainability and success of open-source projects.

**Research Questions**

The project addresses four key research questions:

_**1. What is the average lifespan of contributors in open-source software repositories?**_
   This question investigates how long contributors typically remain active in open-source projects and explores correlations between contributor lifespan and repository features.

_**2. Identify the factors that might influence the retention rate of contributors and check which one most significantly influences the retention rate.**_
   This inquiry seeks to understand what factors contribute to retaining contributors in open-source projects and identifies the most impactful factors.

_**3. What is the impact of contributor turnover on the frequency of software releases?**_
   This research question examines how changes in contributor participation affect the timing and frequency of software releases.

_**4. How does developer tenure impact the quality of FOSS projects?**_
   This study investigates whether longer developer tenure is associated with better software quality, focusing on metrics such as defect density and issue resolution time.

**Project Structure**

To navigate this project, please refer to the following directories and files:

**Data:** Contains all four data extracts used for the project.

**Data Extraction Scripts:** Holds scripts used for extracting data from GitHub.

**Data Analysis:** Holds scripts for data analysis for all RQs.
Additionally, individual folders for each research question also contain analysis scripts and related data.

**Top_1000_repos.docx:** A document listing the top 1000 repositories used as the sample space we used for random sampling in this study.

**Top_1000_repos.ipynb:** A Jupyter notebook script used to extract the list of top repositories.

This structure should help you locate and explore the data and analysis for each research question.
