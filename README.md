<H2 style="text-align:center;align-items:center;">Forked and Forgotten: The Uncertain Lifespan of Open-Source Developers</H2>

This project explores the dynamics of open-source software development, focusing on the lifespan and retention of contributors in open-source projects. The study aims to provide insights into how different factors influence the sustainability and success of open-source projects.

**Research Questions**

The project addresses four key research questions:

_**1. What is the average lifespan of contributors in open-source software repositories?**_
   This question investigates how long contributors typically remain active in open-source projects and explores correlations between contributor lifespan and repository features.

_**2. Identify the factors that might influence the retention rate of contributors and check which one most significantly influences the retention rate.**_
   This inquiry seeks to understand what factors contribute to retaining contributors in open-source projects and identifies the most impactful factors.

_**3. What is the impact of contributor turnover on the frequency of software releases?**_
   This research question examines how changes in contributor participation affect the timing and frequency of software releases.

_**4. How does developer tenure impact the quality of FOSS projects?**_
   This study investigates whether longer developer tenure is associated with better software quality, focusing on metrics such as defect density and issue resolution time.
